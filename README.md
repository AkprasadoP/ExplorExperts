# ExplorExperts
Travel-Agency(my first Project!)

**ExplorExperts** is my very first web development project, created with the goal of improving my front-end development skills. This project simulates a simple travel agency website and is entirely built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a bit of **JavaScript** used to add some interactivity — even though I was just getting started with JavaScript at the time.

## ✨ About the Project

As a self-taught developer exploring the world of web development, I wanted to challenge myself to build a functional and clean website without relying on modern frameworks. This project reflects the kind of design and structure a beginner might implement while learning the core concepts of HTML and CSS.

Originally, **ExplorExperts was intended to be a full-stack travel agency website**, but due to limited knowledge of backend technologies at the time, I kept it focused on the front-end. I do plan to revisit and complete it with full-stack functionality in the future as I gain more experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – For the structure and layout
- **CSS3** – For design, styling, and layout responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Used minimally for interactivity (like button clicks or form validation)

## 💡 Learning Experience

This project helped me:
- Understand the importance of clean HTML structure
- Apply consistent CSS styling and reusability
- Start exploring JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Think through how a user would interact with a simple UI

## 🧪 How to Run

> To view the website, simply **open the `index.html` file in your code editor and run it using a Live Server extension** (like the Live Server extension in VS Code).

This project reflects beginner-level thinking and a curiosity to build something from the ground up with limited knowledge — a stepping stone toward bigger, full-stack applications in the future.

## 📌 Note

This is a beginner project and does not include advanced features or responsive design frameworks. It’s meant to show learning progress and a foundational understanding of front-end development.
